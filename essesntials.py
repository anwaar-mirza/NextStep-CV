example = "Hi, I’m Johnathan Smith, a tech enthusiast with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a little over four years of hands-on experience in software development and data analysis. You can reach me at +1 234-567-8901 or drop me an email at john.smith@email.com. I’m pretty active on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/johnsmith) and love sharing my work on GitHub (github.com/johnsmith), where you’ll find projects like a real-time data dashboard, a web scraping tool, and even an AI chatbot. My go-to skills are Python, JavaScript, SQL, and a bit of machine learning, along with some cloud magic using AWS and Azure. I’ve worked with clients from finance to healthcare to e-commerce, solving problems and building things that actually make a difference. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hiking, taking photos, or geeking out over the latest tech trends. References?"
